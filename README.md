# Bilingual-Embedding-Intrinsic-Evaluation

 This repository contains the test collection for measuring word similarity or relatedness of English-Tamil bilingual embedding. This dataset contains 750 word pairs scored by 13 human subjects. The dataset is scored based on similarity rather than association. It is not focused on any particular relation, but on the reader’s cognitive perception. We use this dataset for evaluating the English–Tamil bilingual word vectors obtained using BilBOWA algorithm in the below mentioned paper. This dataset can be used to evaluate any English-Tamil Bilingual embedding.


 If you publish results based on this dataset, please reference this paper.
